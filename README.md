Hi, I’m @riowiraldhani
DevOps enthusiast by day, professional sleeper by night.
I automate stuff, break things (sometimes on purpose), fix them, and make systems run smoother than fresh coffee.
Big fan of fast pipelines, auto scaling, and full 8-hour naps.

If it scales, I love it. If it crashes, I’ll fix it (after a nap).
